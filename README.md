# rock-paper-scissors-game

Rock paper scissors is a simultaneous, zero-sum, two-player game. 

Each player chooses one of three options - "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors". The rules are as follows:
Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock, and Scissors beat Paper. If both players choose the same option, the result is a draw.

When playing against a real person, there is some element of skill involved, trying to guess which option your opponent will pick next.
However, in my version, you will be playing against the Computer, who always chooses randomly. So you never know who will end up winning!
