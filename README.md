**Rock paper scissors is a simultaneous, zero-sum, two-player game.**

**Each player chooses one of three options - "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors". 
The rules are as follows: Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock, and Scissors beat Paper. If both players choose the same option, the result is a draw.**

**When playing against a real person, there is some element of skill involved, trying to guess which option your opponent will pick next.**
**However, in this version, you will be playing against the Computer, which always chooses randomly. So you never know who will end up winning!**

**The game is in a console-only format, so all you need to do to play is download the *rock_paper_scissors_game.py* file and run it on your OS console or through your favorite IDE!**

***So, what are you waiting for? Try your luck!***
